		"description": "`Digital Horizon - Phenomenology of Modern Technologies` takes employees across all levels on a journey through the digital landscape of modern workplaces. This innovative program begins with a preparatory phase, gathering real-world challenges from various departments. Participants then dive into a blend of theory and practice, exploring digital phenomena and their impact on daily work. As they navigate the course, employees enhance their digital literacy, learning to discern credible information from manipulation in the online world. Participants not only master key technologies like GitHub, Docker, and selected AWS Cloud Services, but also acquire the precise language of the digital realm. This dual proficiency unveils the inner workings of both tools and concepts, as terminology serves as a key to unlock deeper understanding. By the journey's end, they create their own personalized minimal examples of implemented solution, equipped with new knowledge and practical skills to immediately enhance their work processes. `Digital Horizon doesn't just teach about the digital world â€“ it empowers employees to shape it`.",
